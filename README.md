[JavaScript file to Create Data Table](https://github.com/c-geisel/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js)

## Overview of Project
In a previous analysis we were presented with a set of data about UFO sightings in a small town in Oregon. This town is famous for these sightings and they were looked into more throughout the analysis. Using the data file, JavaScript was used to display the information as a table with data so that filters could be applied. All of this information was then displayed in an HTML page. This current analysis is applying changes to this webpage by adding more filter options to the HTML page. This is done by modifying functions in the JavaScript file.

## Results
Upon reafactoring the scripts a website is obtained with 5 filters as seen below.

This webpage has an article about the existence of UFOs that can be read, then below is the data table with filters. To use this data to your advantage, choose a filter you want to add. Let's say you want to see all of the UFO sightings in Ohio, type "oh" into the filter and once the typing is complete the data is filtered to all sightings in this state.

Multiple filters can be applied at once as well. For example, you can find all sightings in California on January 6, 2010 by entering in "ca" and "1/6/2010" into their respective filters.

To return to the original unfiltered data table, click the "UFO Sightings" link on the top left-hand corner of the screen to return to the initial data table.
